# Unity-BasicPlayerControl

Description:
------------

Create a basic Player Controller for your Unity projects *

* (now by either using the old input system or the new input system)


REPO NOTE: The purpose of this repository was decided upon recently when
revisiting the several individual repositories that I have provided that have
included the player control script used as an example controller to see
functionalities / usages of other provided scripts
(ie: Unity-BasicVehiclesControl_ForSyntyCity repo,
Unity-BasicVehiclesControl_ForSyntyHeist repo,
Unity-BasicVehiclesControl_ForSyntyBR repo, Unity-BasicNavigationControl
repo, etc, etc...) and as such now deciding to have an individual repo for such basic
player control script in the event that say any changes and or updates may be
made to such here even say if and or not any such changes will be made to
various repos that such was originally inluded in as an example usage.
Hopefully that makes sense.
